# Project #1 LIBFT, Nov 2014
>>>>> #####Personal C Library

#####Grade ``(102/100)`` ``(102/108)*``
--------  -----------------------
<br>
As very few libC's and functions are allowed in school's projects,
this library regroups all kinds <BR>of useful functions `prefixed by ft_`
that i will be reuse in my C projects.
<br>

~50 specific functions were required for the project itelf, but i frequently update it with new functions (~125 now).
<br>

### Content:
* Most `<ctype.h>` fuctions.
* Most `<string.h>` fuctions.
* `std::vector like` functions.
* `std::list like` functions.
* `std::set like` functions (implemented as an AVL). Also works as an `std::map`.
